# Python One Liners
Exercises done in one line of Python

## Why Do I Do This
I do this for fun. Just a little time killer when I'm in the middle of coding and I need to put my mind somewhere else. Also I learn a bit more about different parts of Python. Both when I research solutions and by looking at other people's work. Also I want to improve in the art of the Python one liner

## Stuff That Inspires Me
[**Obfuscating "Hello world!"** By Ben Kurtovic](https://benkurtovic.com/2014/06/01/obfuscating-hello-world.html)

## ALSO
- These aren't good solutions at all. Most are very ineffective and have a lot of improvments that could be made.
